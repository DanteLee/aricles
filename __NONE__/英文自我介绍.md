### 开头

Good afternoon, dear professors. I'm honored to be here for this interview.

### 自我介绍

My name is xxx, a 22 years old graduate from School of Computer Science & Engineering, [UESTC](http://www.uestc.edu.cn/ "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China "). During my life of University, I major in Information Security and I learned a lot from it. I also took part in a student work studio in my spare time. I have to say, i really enjoy working with these enthusiastic and lovely guys. 

### 特长介绍

I think my most highlighted character is that i can keep persistent enthusiasm in my loved field. For Example, I'm very interested in network programming with C programming language. As you know, building a network program is not an easy job at all and bug is the monster you can't escape from. But i used to spend two days working on a stubborn bug and finally fixed it.

### 面试相关的内容

I'm familiar with several programming language, such as C, JavaScript, and also some markup language and style language, such as HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheet). I also took part in some WEB based projects.

### 结尾

That's a brief introduction of myself. Thank you.
